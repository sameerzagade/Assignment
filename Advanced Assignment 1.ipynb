    "\n",
    "Modularity: OOP allows developers to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts (or objects). Each object is an instance of a class, which is like a blueprint.\n",
    "Reusability: Classes can be defined once and reused many times, which prevents code repetition.\n",
    "Scalability: OOP makes it easier to manage larger programs3. As new objects can be easily created from a class, it allows the program to scale efficiently.\n",
    "Real-world modeling: OOP provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. \n",
    "    This makes it easier to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc., in programming.\n",

    "In Python’s Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), when you access an attribute of an object, the search for that attribute takes place in the following order:\n",

    "Class Attributes: If the attribute is not found in the instance, Python then looks in the class to which the instance belongs.\n",
